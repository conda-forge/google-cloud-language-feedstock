    Python Client for Google Cloud Natural Language
    -------------------------

    The [Google Cloud Natural Language](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) API can be used to reveal the
    structure and meaning of text via powerful machine
    learning models. You can use it to extract information about
    people, places, events and much more, mentioned in text documents,
    news articles or blog posts. You can use it to understand
    sentiment about your product on social media or parse intent from
    customer conversations happening in a call center or a messaging
    app. You can analyze text uploaded in your request or integrate
    with your document storage on Google Cloud Storage.
